      "1": {
        "title": "1. Who is this platform for?",
        "content": "ScamNemesis is for people who want to verify a person, company, phone number, email, or website The list can be found here. It's also for people who have already been scammed and want to report their case and connect with other victims of the same perpetrator. The platform helps both everyday users and professionals — police, journalists, lawyers, analysts, banks, and exchanges. Reported cases can be sent to partners via API who can pause payments to protect your money (service in preparation). All reports are manually reviewed by experts before publication.\n\nDistinguishing a scam from a legitimate service is hard today — anyone can be fooled. If it happened to you, you're not alone; we're here to help."
      },
      "2": {
        "title": "2. What problem are we solving?",
        "content": "There is no single \"global\" number, but data shows that online fraud grew by roughly 2,300% between 2019 and 2024; in 2024, estimated losses reached USD 1.03 trillion. In practice, one scammer can create 10–100 cases per month, which fragments evidence and severely overloads the police, making effective case resolution difficult.\n\nScamNemesis brings order to this chaos: it consolidates reports and evidence into a single coordinated case, automatically links victims with similar patterns, saves investigators time, and accelerates investigations. It also works preventively — anyone can verify a person, company, domain, phone number, and 38 additional identifiers associated with scams. The tool is free and available to everyone."
      },
      "3": {
        "title": "3. How to use ScamNemesis?",
        "content": "Search:\n\nAt the top, you'll find the search bar where you can enter a name, email, phone number, and other identifiers list is here. Results are shown by match score — the lower an item appears, the weaker the match, so we recommend checking more cases. Clicking a Case opens a report with all information provided by the reporter. Some data is anonymized for safety and legal reasons. Reports may include photos, documents, and comments from others; you can also add your own comment. The \"Find similar cases\" feature shows records with the highest similarity and explains exactly what matched and to what degree (e.g., the same phone number).\n\nReporting:\n\nIf you've been scammed, click Report scam. A form will open — most fields are optional, but we recommend adding as many details as possible. Reporter data is kept strictly anonymous and not shared; we don't require a real name or primary email (you can use a separate address just for this). Keep your access details safe. You will receive instructions and a link by email to manage your case — add, edit, or delete it from the database.\n\nInterpreting matches:\n\nRemember that the same name ≠ the same person. If you search \"John Smith\" in the USA and find a \"John Smith\" in the UK for a different type of scam, it's likely just a namesake. Evaluate the context (country, scam type, time, other identifiers). The most reliable signals are unique data such as email, phone number, bank account/IBAN, or a crypto address. Don't jump to conclusions — stay cautious."
      },
      "4": {
        "title": "4. Why is this important?",
        "content": "Every unreported scam helps scammers reach more victims, causes more ruined lives, and creates more suffering for victims and their families. We want to stop that.\n\nWhen communities share data across countries, patterns emerge: the same \"investment opportunity\" pops up in dozens of states, the identical profile photo runs across dozens of fake accounts, and the same crypto wallet links to known scam networks. Shared intelligence breaks their biggest advantage — isolation. One person's warning becomes protection for everyone.\n\nScamNemesis unifies, cleans, and evaluates these signals so investigative teams can prioritize what matters. That's why we build simple integrations — API, widget, and forensic tools — so data can be used immediately in external systems to deliver real prevention and a faster response."
      },
      "5": {
        "title": "5. Why did we create this project?",
        "content": "The project was born out of anger and frustration with ineffective police methods. We ourselves became victims of fraud, and the police could not help because they were overwhelmed and lacked the tools and expertise to tackle modern types of scams. When someone loses all their money, it is devastating for them and their family. This has to stop!\n\nPolice units that are expected to \"help\" in the hardest moments and be reliable often cannot assist, while modern scam crime is growing at an alarming scale.\n\nIt is time to act, so we decided to use our knowledge of OSINT, hacking, and intelligence to help people and investigative teams with prevention and detection of fraud."
      },
      "6": {
        "title": "6. What is ScamNemesis?",
        "content": "A community-driven verification and intelligence platform that combines a reported-scam database, blockchain tracing, monitoring across 130+ data sources, phone and email verification, face recognition, document forensics (OCR + metadata analysis), and relationship mapping. For example, you can enter a phone number, crypto wallet, or a person's name and instantly see whether it's flagged, who/what it is linked to, and which behavior pattern it matches.\n\nWe are also building forensic tools used by investigators and integrating them into our platform to be even more effective. We share signals with law-enforcement authorities, partner banks, and other high-risk platforms to maximize your chances of recovering funds if you become a victim."
      },
      "7": {
        "title": "7. What will you find here?",
        "content": "A search system for more than 38 identifiers (e.g., name, email, phone, etc.) that helps you determine whether you're dealing with a scammer and protect your assets. You'll find the exact list of supported identifiers and a guide on how to search in our system.\n\nWhen there's a match, a report appears with all available details about the suspect and relevant case information to help you minimize risk. You can also report an incident and find other victims of the same perpetrator — through coordination and information sharing, the chances of exposure and prosecution rise significantly."
      },
      "8": {
        "title": "8. Who is behind this project?",
        "content": "An international team of investigators and ethical hackers from three continents and more than five countries — experts in cybersecurity, data analytics, and professionals with training and experience in intelligence tradecraft.\n\nOur goal is to remain free forever. Because pure self-funding is not sustainable long term, part of the project will include advertising, and we will seek additional support through grants and donations from the public (if you'd like to help, you can donate here). All methodology, data sources, and funding will be publicly documented. We build on transparency because trust must be earned — not merely declared."
